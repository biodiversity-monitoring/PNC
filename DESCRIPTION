Description: Provides comprehensive tools for analyzing phylogenetic niche conservatism in ecological communities. The package implements multiple statistical methods (Pagel's Lambda, Blomberg's K, Moran's I, and others) to quantify phylogenetic signal in species trait data across single or multiple communities. Methods are described in Münkemüller et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00196.x> and Keck et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/ece3.2051>.
