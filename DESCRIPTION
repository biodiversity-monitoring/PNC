Description: Provides functions for testing phylogenetic niche conservatism, a key prerequisite in community assembly studies. The package integrates global functional trait data across major taxonomic groups and implements methods such as Pagel's Lambda and Blomberg's K to quantify phylogenetic signals in ecological communities. Methods are described in Münkemüller et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00196.x>.
