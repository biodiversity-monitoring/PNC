}
\description{
This function conducts comprehensive phylogenetic niche conservatism analysis across multiple
communities simultaneously. It evaluates phylogenetic signal for trait data across different
community assemblages using various statistical methods, enabling comparative assessment of
niche conservatism patterns among communities. The function processes community composition
matrices, species trait information, and phylogenetic trees to determine whether closely
related species consistently occupy similar ecological niches across different habitats
or sampling locations.
